          <h3 class="font-extrabold">What is a crypto currency?</h3>
          <p>
            A cryptocurrency like bitcoin is a virtual currency traded
            peer-to-peer on a blockchain, independent of centralized authorities
            like banks and governments. Cryptocurrencies are entirely virtual,
            so they are not backed by physical commodities and have no intrinsic
            value.

          <h3 class="font-extrabold">How Do Cryptocurrencies Work?</h3>
          <p>
            Primarily, cryptocurrencies rely on blockchain technology to
            complete a transaction via an intricate P2P network. Once a transfer
            request is entered into the network, it is validated by the network
            and added to a pool of other transactions to create a block of data
            for the ledger, which is then entered into the existing blockchain.
            Once the block is successfully added to the chain, the transaction
            is approved and completed.

            Are There Investment Opportunities with Cryptocurrencies?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Absolutely. Cryptocurrencies have become established investment
            commodities among major financial institutions and have even been
            adopted by countries such as Australia and Japan. As with any
            investment though, there are risks linked to market movements, high
            volatility and economics.
